   CONTENT BLOCK for the history WAGOLL family.
   This is the ONLY place the wall text lives. wagoll-wall.html,
   level-sheets.html and interactive.html all read it, so editing here
   updates the wall, the per-level A3 sheets and the interactive at once.

   This is the wall for History 1, Ancient Australia, and it is on the site.

   ONE ITEM IS STILL OPEN: the framing has not been checked with the Wurundjeri
   Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation. Both sources here were
   made by colonists and no Kulin record of the meeting survives, which the wall
   states, but stating it is not the same as having the framing reviewed. The
   item is named on the topic page as well as here, and closing it may change
   the wording.

   The painting is reproduced at 1600x800 from the file supplied for this
   build. It is John Wesley Burtt, circa 1875, State Library of Victoria
   accession H92.196. The painting itself is long out of copyright; the
   reproduction's own terms still need confirming with SLV before print.
   See SOURCE-NOTICE.md.

   Mark evidence in an example with {key|the phrase}, where key is one of
   the criterion keys in CRITERIA. Anything left unmarked stays black.

The painting is {judge|useful for showing what people wore and carried}, but it {judge|cannot show me what was really said}.`,

"Year 6":
`The source is a {source|painting of Batman's meeting with the Kulin Nation}, showing {source|gifts laid out on the ground and people talking}. It was painted to {context|remember an event some colonists were proud of}. {evidence|Batman claimed the Kulin people agreed to sell their land}, but {evidence|the Proclamation says such a sale was never allowed}. The painting is {judge|useful for showing how colonists pictured the meeting}, although {judge|it cannot tell us what the Kulin people actually thought}.`,

"Year 7":
`The event is {source|Batman's meeting with Kulin leaders in June 1835}. The painting is {source|a later artwork by John Wesley Burtt, made about forty years afterwards to record the meeting}. At this time, {context|Batman wanted land, and colonists were arguing about whether buying land from Aboriginal people was even allowed}. {evidence|Batman's own deed, the paper in his hand in the painting, says the Kulin people agreed to sell}; {evidence|Bourke's Proclamation says any such sale was ‘void and of no effect’}. The painting is {judge|useful for showing how the meeting was later remembered}, but {judge|it was painted forty years later, by someone who was not there}.`,

"Year 8":
`The painting is {source|Burtt's 1875 artwork of Batman's 1835 meeting with the Kulin Nation}, made to {source|show the meeting as calm and friendly}. {context|In the 1830s, Britain claimed Australia belonged to no one, so land could not legally be bought from its people}. {evidence|Batman argued his treaty was a fair purchase}; {evidence|Bourke's Proclamation rejects that, calling every such treaty ‘void’}; {evidence|the painting takes neither side, it simply shows the meeting happening}. The painting is {judge|useful evidence of how the meeting was later pictured}, but {judge|it cannot be trusted as a record of what was said or agreed, because the artist was not there}.`,

"Year 9":
`The event is {source|Batman's 1835 meeting with Kulin leaders}; the source used here is {source|Burtt's 1875 painting, made forty years later for people who had not seen it happen}. {context|The meeting sits inside a bigger argument: colonists wanted land, while British law increasingly held that Aboriginal people could not sell land they were said not to own}. {evidence|Batman's deed presents willing agreement}; {evidence|Bourke's Proclamation presents the opposite, that no agreement could ever be legal}; {evidence|the two documents disagree because they were written for different purposes, one to justify a land claim, one to control it}. The painting is {judge|strong evidence of how colonists wanted the meeting remembered}, but {judge|weak evidence of what actually happened, since no Kulin account of the day survives}.`,

"Year 10":
`The source is {source|a colonial painting of a disputed meeting}. Its {source|explicit content is a peaceful exchange of goods}; its {source|implicit message is that Batman's claim to the land was fair and orderly}, aimed at {source|later Australians who wanted to believe the colony began well}. {context|Painted in 1875, it reflects the values of its own time: order, progress, and an easy conscience about how the colony was founded}. {evidence|Batman's treaty and Bourke's Proclamation give opposite answers to one question, could this land be bought}; {evidence|they differ because one argues for private ownership and the other for the Crown's sole authority over the land}. Overall, the painting is {judge|useful evidence of memory and myth-making, but poor evidence of the event itself}: {judge|it was made decades later, by an artist who never saw the meeting, and no Kulin account from the day survives to check it against}.`
